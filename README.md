# Rijeka.hr open source redesign (Design files)

You can find design files for **Rijeka.hr open source redesign project**. Website will be built on WordPress and all the source files including design files, HTML and CSS (SASS) files and WordPress theme – will be made available to the public.

In the redesign process we’re addressing the issues of accessibility, usability, information architecture and general transparency of information in the local government. The process of redesign is being documented on our redesign blog http://redizajn.rijeka.hr/ (in Croatian).

We hope that other cities in Croatia will use these assets to build their own websites.

These templates are provided for educational purpose and to be used by other cities since they represent best practices.

Sharing is caring.
